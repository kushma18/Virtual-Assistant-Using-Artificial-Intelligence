# Virtual-Assistant-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
This is one of my projects in which I used concepts of AI to create an Automated machine...

This is an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Assistant. It works only through voice commands. An AI personal assistant is a piece of software that understands verbal commands and completes tasks assigned by the client. It is an example of weak AI in that it can only execute and perform quests designed by the user. In some cases, agents are exclusively for entertainment purposes. Some virtual assistants are ready to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistant questions, play songs, shut down, restart, lock windows, and manage other basic tasks like email, to-do lists, calendars, etc with verbal commands. The Main idea of our project is to develop a virtual assistant that works based on our voice commands and does automation of tasks. The assistant helps the user to perform his/her functions making his work more easier. It will be implemented with the concept of Natural Language Processing(NLP) which is a branch of AI that deals with the interaction of computers and human languages.
